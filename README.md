# Lead_Generation_AI_Agent
An autonomous system to qualify &amp; respond to inbound leads using n8n, Relevance AI, and automated email workflows.


ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an AI-powered lead generation agent that automatically qualifies and responds to inbound leads via email. It reduces manual work by intelligently filtering leads, scoring them with contextual AI, and sending personalized replies â€” all through n8n workflows and Relevance AI.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
As companies scale their marketing efforts, they often receive a high volume of inbound inquiries â€” many of which are not a good fit for their product or service. These leads may be too small, from the wrong industry, or not aligned with the companyâ€™s offering. The process of evaluating and deciding whether to engage with a lead is known as lead qualification. This AI-powered agent is designed to automate that exact process, reducing the need for manual research and filtering.

ðŸ’¼ Value
Rather than relying on manual qualification by sales reps or rigid rule-based systems that may overlook high-potential leads, this intelligent automation uses contextual AI to evaluate each inquiry in real-time. It ensures the right leads are prioritized and routed for follow-up â€” saving time, reducing human error, and enabling the sales team to focus on closing deals instead of sorting through unqualified leads.
